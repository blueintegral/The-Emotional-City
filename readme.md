==================
See hscott.net/the-emotional-city

You'll need an Arduino with an Ethernet shield. You'll also need to replace the string ALCHEMY-API-KEY-HERE with your Alchemy API key. Finally, you need to replace "Glen%20Ellyn%2C%20IL" in the Twitter search URL with the location you choose. You can either edit it directly or set up the search on Twitter and copy the URL in.
